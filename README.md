This repository contains the implementation of a Question Answering System using an open-source LLM (such as Llama). The system is designed to answer questions based on provided data, and the model is fine-tuned on custom datasets.

Key Features
Open-Source LLM: The system is built using a freely available, open-source LLM (e.g., Llama).
Fine-Tuning: The LLM is fine-tuned on your own data to improve its accuracy in answering domain-specific questions.
